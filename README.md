# Emotion-Recognition-Neural-Network
A graduate project that I made achieving the highest efficiency within the class with an 81.4% micro F1 score. It focused on utilizing a test and training dataset to develop a neural network using Tensorflow that can predict the emotions being evoked within a datatset of sentences.

Within this repo, the .ipynb file will be attached containing the main code of the neural network showcasing the best run the neural network was able to achieve.

# Objectives

The learning objectives of this assignment were to:
1. build a neural network for a community task 
2. practice tuning model hyper-parameters
3. Implement a recurrent or convolutional network to apply what was learned within the class
